# Invariants Explained

Here you will find a list of the more confusing invariants we throw at you to show you how much we love you.

## ActionCreator invariants

```js
invariant(
	!DisplayNames.has(options.displayName),
	`ActionCreator - Your displayName of ${options.displayName} is not unique.`
);
```
All ActionCreators must have a unique `displayName` for debugging readability

```js
invariant(
	type !== undefined,
	`The method ${name} could not be created on ${this}; type must be provided`
);
```
Without an `type`, stores most likely wont know what to do with an action. This mostly helps out when you accidentally pass `undefined` due to a typo'd constant.

## Dispatcher invariants
```js
invariant(
  action.type !== undefined && action.type !== null,
  `Attempted to dispatch an action with unrecognizable type ${action.type}`,
);
```
You don't want to dispatch things without a type. This might be caused by one of two problems:
 - You are dispatching things manually because you hate our `ActionCreator`, and not using it like this:
   ```js
   Dispatcher.dispatch({source, type, payload});
   ```
 - You provided `type`, but its value is `null` or `undefined`, most likely due to a typo.

```js
invariant(
  !err,
  'Actions must be simple objects, and must be stringifyable.'
);
```
Somehow you managed to dispatch a payload which caused JSON.stringify to barf. Hats off to you! We're kind of on the fence about this restriction (someone might want to dispatch immutables directly, which would error out here), so give us some feedback if you don't like it.

```js
invariant(
  JSON.stringify(action) === serializedAction,
  `An action dispatched by the FluxThis dispatcher was
  mutated. This is bad. Please check the handlers for
  ${action.type}`
);
```
**WARNING**: you dispatched something, and then CHANGED that something. This practice will lead to horrible, uncontrollable, hard-to-track-down bugs, as stores receive modified payloads that they don't understand. Don't do it!.
